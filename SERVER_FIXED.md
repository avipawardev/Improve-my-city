# Server Issues Fixed

## Issues Resolved:

1. **Port Conflict (5000 → 8000)**
   - Port 5000 was occupied by macOS ControlCenter
   - Changed server port to 8000 in `.env`
   - Updated client `.env.local` to match

2. **CORS Configuration Enhanced**
   - Added explicit methods and headers
   - Prevents CORS-related errors

3. **Server Error Handling**
   - Added error handler for port conflicts
   - Server exits gracefully with clear error message

4. **Client API URL**
   - Fixed to include `/api` path: `http://localhost:8000/api`

## How to Start:

### Option 1: Using the script
```bash
./start-server.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual start
```bash
cd server
node server.js
```

### Option 3: Development mode
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

## Server is now running on:
- **Port**: 8000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health
- **API Base**: http://localhost:8000/api

## Client Configuration:
- Update your client to use: `http://localhost:8000/api`
- Already configured in `client/.env.local`

## Test the server:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return: {"status":"OK","message":"Server is running"}
```

All errors are resolved! ✅
